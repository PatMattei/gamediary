# gamediary

GameDiary can be found at https://gamediary.herokuapp.com/. It's a site where users can log their daily video-game playing habits, including specigic games they played and text entries about what they did. A user can log a general entry for the day in addition to specific entries on each game that they played.

Tech Used:
Styling is mostly done with Bootstrap and I challenge myself to stay as close to the framework as possible, without having to force my own spacing and sizing. I also used Bootswatch's Flatly theme for color and general styling.

Stretch Goals:
I’d liked to hook this up to an API to pull game entries and art
The ability to embed media for a game entry (ex. a Twitch saved video or a screenshot the user took in the game that day)
Actual user profiles
Showing only a selected month’s entries on Index
Tags for entries
