GameDiary can be found at https://gamediary.herokuapp.com/. It's a site where users can log their daily video-game playing habits, including specific games they played and text entries about what they did. A user can log a general entry for the day in addition to specific entries on each game that they played.

Tech Used:
GameDairy is built on React, Express, and jQuery. I used Axios dependency to work with making API calls.
Styling is mostly done with Bootstrap. I challenged myself to stay as close to the framework as possible, without having to force my own spacing and sizing. I also used Bootswatch's Flatly theme for color and general styling.

Challenges:
Passing arrray data to my database and being able to update that data. Some form fields are hardcoded as required to get it wokring properly, but  Iwould liek to change that in the future.
Working with API calls.

Stretch Goals:
I’d liked to hook this up to an API to pull game entries and art
The ability to embed media for a game entry (ex. a Twitch saved video or a screenshot the user took in the game that day)
Actual user profiles
Showing only a selected month’s entries on Index
Tags for entries
